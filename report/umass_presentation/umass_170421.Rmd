## Aims
Gain a better understanding how opioid deaths differ **by race** and what has contributed to the change in trends over time. 

**Stratify by age** and look at 

- Underlying cause of death
- Deaths by opioid type
- Presence of multiple opioids

Motivate future research to better target health policy and rehabilitation programs in different areas and for different subpopulations.

## Data and approach
- Multiple cause of death microdata, 2000--2015
    - Deaths are coded according to ICD-10
    - Underlying cause of death and up to twenty additional contributory causes
- Restrict analysis to non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic black population
- Overall mortality rates are age-standardized using 10-year age groups and the 2000 Census population as a standard
- Calculation of stochastic standard errors 
    - For death rates: Poisson approximation to normal
    - For proportions: Wilson method for binomial confidence intervals

## Defining opioid-related deaths
Opioid poisoning T-codes:

- T400: Opium
- T401: Heroin
- T402: Other natural and semi-synthetic opioids
- T403: Methadone
- T404: Other synthetic opioids 
- T406: Unspecified

1. Drug overdose deaths: combination of T-codes and underlying cause of overdose: X40-44, X60-64, Y10-14, X85
2. Mental and behavioral complications due to opioid use (F110--F119)
3. Other deaths with an opioid T-code as contibutory cause

##  Key findings
Three key observations came out of analysis:

> 1. Main type of opioids underlying deaths has shifted 
> 2. Age distribution of deaths differs by race
> 3. Presence of multiple opioids has increased


<!-- ## Deaths by underlying cause -->

<!-- ## Deaths by underlying cause -->
<!-- What are the main **underlying causes** associated with opioid deaths? -->

<!-- - Accidental overdose due to opioids (X42) -->
<!-- - Accidental overdose due to other or unspecified drugs also important (X44) -->
<!-- - Suicide higher for white population (X64) -->

## 1. Type of opioids underlying deaths has shifted

<!-- ## 1. Type of opioids underlying deaths has shifted  -->

<!-- - The increase in the 2000--2010 period was more substantial for the white population and was due to prescription painkillers (mostly Vicodin, OxyContin and methadone).  -->
<!-- - Since 2010, the rates of opioid-mortality increase for both the white and black populations have been largely due to heroin and fentanyl.  -->

## 2. Age distribution of deaths differs by race

## 2. Age distribution of deaths differs by race
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./plots/fig7_t40_heroin_ci.pdf}


<!-- ## 2. Age distribution of deaths differs by race -->
<!-- - Younger age profile for white population compared to black popualation -->
<!-- - For recent heroin/fentanyl increases, mortality rates decrease with age for white population, but increase with age for black population -->
<!-- - Heroin deaths rates are similar or higher for black population for ages 40+ -->

## 3. Presence of multiple opoids has increased

## 3. Presence of multiple opoids has increased
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./plots/fig9_t401_combos_v_ci.pdf}


<!-- ## 3. Presence of multiple opoids has increased -->
<!-- - Increase in proportion of deaths with multiple opioids since 2013 matches spike in heroin/fentanyl -->
<!-- - Proportion of non-heroin opioid deaths involving heroin increasing for both races -->
<!-- - Higher proportion of black opioid deaths have multiple opioids -->


## Summary
1. The trend in opioid deaths since 2000 has two stages. 
- 2000--2010: increase for the white population, driven by prescription opioids
- 2010 onwards: 
    - Exhibited a higher rate of increase in the opioid deaths
    - Increases were similar for both the white and black populations
    - Heroin and fentanyl-related opioids
2. Increases in deaths due to heroin and fentanyl have occurred from deaths that involve a mixture of both drugs. 
3. White population exhibiting a comparatively younger age profile.



## Questions / future work
1. How much of increase in heroin mortality is due to increased use versus increased potency?
2. What is driving the differences in age by race?

Drawing on:

- More detailed multiple cause of death data with residence information
- Data on prescriptions dispensed and drug use (e.g. National Survey of Drug Use and Health)
